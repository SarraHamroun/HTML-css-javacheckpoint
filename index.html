                <p> Netflix was launched in 1998. At that point, there was no HD technology nor streaming culture. Yet
                    the pursuit of comfort and accessibility was in fact what sprung the business idea. Let us talk
                    history; in 1996, Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph were struck by the emergence of the e-commerce
                    phenomenon in general, and the birth of Amazon in particular. They then wanted to reinterpret its
                    business idea of home delivery and bring it to a field where they perceived an upcoming market
                    demand. That field being home entertainment. Until that point, people would rent movies on VHS from
                    brick-and-mortar stores. So when the DVD was invented in 1996, the two entrepreneurs took advantage
                    of the lightweight of the discs which would not cost much to be shipped to users.

        <h1>Netflix endorsing Formula 1</h1>
        <p>he company decided to join the sport industry by creating an exclusive content for its subscribers by
            stepping in the sport industry ,that’s why it chose the motosport industry and more precisely F1 by making
            the most successful sport show ‘drive to survive’.The main goal of this show is to stimulate the popularity
            of the sport in the US .
            By forging a partnership with the FIA , the platform has announced drive to survive .
            First of all F1 community is growing year after year with a total audience of 1.3 billion people .
            The whole concept is not about the sport of racing (by the way it’s very cool part of it) ,but it’s about
            the story line of humans competing in the sport .</p>
        <br>
        <div>
            <img src="f1.jpeg" alt="F1"><br>
        </div>
        <p>If Netflix is great at something ,it’s showing the human side of things .
            The idea is unique because none think of doing it and also very simple in putting things together : Imagine
            that , the total of teams is ten and the total of drivers is twenty .Is there any sport that has less people
            involved ?? even if we include the teams principles of each team that will still total 30people to follow ,
            a single football team would have at least the triple amount of that number.
            F1 might be the easiest sport to follow along with and the most prestigious to fall in love in , which prove
            the amount of intelligence Netflix have .</p>
